# Docker container for Vim - Markdown

This is a docker container that encloses a *Vim* configured specifically for editing markdown documents. 
I currently use this container to edit documents in my own *Gitit* wiki.

> WARNING: THis is a work in progress. Once I have a *release* I will complete this document with instructions.
